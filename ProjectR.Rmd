This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

#Comparison of two chromatograms of two separate runs in FPLC

#Purpose: Corresponding fractions were mixed together so making sure they are as close to identical as possible

#Data files were too large to read. So data used is a subset of the data exported from the instrument (only the data necessary to graph is included in the file)

#First plot the data for the first. Already have tidyverse, which includes ggplot (can also edit size of line)

```{r}
ggplot(data = Superdex200_Run1and2_Subset,
       mapping = aes (x = ml_1,
                      y = mAU_1))+
  geom_point(size = .1, color = "red")
```

#then create second plot in the same way

```{r}
ggplot(data = Superdex200_Run1and2_Subset,
      mapping = aes (x = ml_2,
                      y = mAU_2))+
  geom_point(size = .1, color = "blue")
```
#downloaded cowplot and magick 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(magick)
```

#The goal is to combine them but since they dont have the same x or y axis then they can be combined as images hopefully

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data=Superdex200_Run1and2_Subset, aes(x = ml_1,
                      y = mAU_1)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"), # bg of the panel
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA), # bg of the plot
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # get rid of major grid
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # get rid of minor grid
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"), # get rid of legend bg
    legend.box.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent") # get rid of legend panel bg
  )
ggsave(filename = 'plot1.png', device = 'png', bg = 'transparent')
#> Saving 7 x 5 in image

p2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data=Superdex200_Run1and2_Subset, aes(x = ml_2,
                      y = mAU_2)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"), # bg of the panel
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA), # bg of the plot
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # get rid of major grid
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # get rid of minor grid
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"), # get rid of legend bg
    legend.box.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent") # get rid of legend panel bg
  )
ggsave(filename = 'plot2.png', device = 'png', bg = 'transparent')
#> Saving 7 x 5 in image

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

#Combine images of plots

```{r}
plot1 <- image_read('plot1.png')
plot2 <- image_read('plot2.png')

img <- c(plot1, plot2)

image_mosaic(img)
```
